# weatherAPI

Weather dashboard to find out the current weather and the forcast for the next 5 days.

## Purpose

to build an application using third party APIs pulling data from open weather API

## functionality

save the user input to the local storage and then post it to buttons in the list under the search box.

## lesson learnt
dynamically using bootstrap and jquery has become more realised, feel that i need to wireframe the design more and also comment the html because would have issues loading the jquery divs cause the html wasnt coded correctly

need to focus on string manipulation alot more as I get lost when i have to split or manipulate string data from api
going to do string methods over the weekend so i can take advantage of the loop more.

and need to learn maths alot more or find some links for common equations
